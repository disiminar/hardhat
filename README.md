# hardhat
Welcome to the repository where I've embarked on my journey into the world of cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. This project is built on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and has been deployed on the Sepolia Testnet using the powerful Hardhat framework.
### used technologies:
- In tests, I used [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) to interact with the Ethereum contract, and I used [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as my test runner.
